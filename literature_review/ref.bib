ABSTRACT = {Diverse sensing techniques have been developed and combined with machine learning method for forest fire detection, but none of them referred to identifying smoldering and flaming combustion phases. This study attempts to real-time identify different combustion phases using a developed wireless sensor network (WSN)-based multi-sensor system and artificial neural network (ANN). Sensors (CO, CO2, smoke, air temperature and relative humidity) were integrated into one node of WSN. An experiment was conducted using burning materials from residual of forest to test responses of each node under no, smoldering-dominated and flaming-dominated combustion conditions. The results showed that the five sensors have reasonable responses to artificial forest fire. To reduce cost of the nodes, smoke, CO2 and temperature sensors were chiefly selected through correlation analysis. For achieving higher identification rate, an ANN model was built and trained with inputs of four sensor groups: smoke; smoke and CO2; smoke and temperature; smoke, CO2 and temperature. The model test results showed that multi-sensor input yielded higher predicting accuracy (≥82.5%) than single-sensor input (50.9%–92.5%). Based on these, it is possible to reduce the cost with a relatively high fire identification rate and potential application of the system can be tested in future under real forest condition.},

abstract = {As fires grow in intensity and frequency each year, so has the resistance from their anthropic victims in the form of firefighting technology and research. Although it is impossible to completely prevent wildfires, the potential devastation can be minimized if fires are detected and precisely geolocated while still in their nascent phases. Furthermore, automated approaches without human involvement are comparatively more efficient, accurate and capable of monitoring extremely remote and vast areas. With this specific intention, many research groups have proposed numerous approaches in the last several years, which can be grouped broadly into these four distinct categories: sensor nodes, unmanned aerial vehicles, camera networks and satellite surveillance. This review paper discusses notable advancements and trends in these categories, with subsequent shortcomings and challenges. We also describe a technical overview of common prototypes and several analysis models used to diagnose a fire from the raw input data. By writing this paper, we hoped to create a synopsis of the current state of technology in this emergent research area and provide a reference for further developments to other interested researchers.},

abstract={Fires in smart cities can have devastating consequences, causing damage to property, and endangering the lives of citizens. Traditional fire detection methods have limitations in terms of accuracy and speed, making it challenging to detect fires in real time. This paper proposes an improved fire detection approach for smart cities based on the YOLOv8 algorithm, called the smart fire detection system (SFDS), which leverages the strengths of deep learning to detect fire-specific features in real time. The SFDS approach has the potential to improve the accuracy of fire detection, reduce false alarms, and be cost-effective compared to traditional fire detection methods. It can also be extended to detect other objects of interest in smart cities, such as gas leaks or flooding. The proposed framework for a smart city consists of four primary layers: (i) Application layer, (ii) Fog layer, (iii) Cloud layer, and (iv) IoT layer. The proposed algorithm utilizes Fog and Cloud computing, along with the IoT layer, to collect and process data in real time, enabling faster response times and reducing the risk of damage to property and human life. The SFDS achieved state-of-the-art performance in terms of both precision and recall, with a high precision rate of 97.1{\%} for all classes. The proposed approach has several potential applications, including fire safety management in public areas, forest fire monitoring, and intelligent security systems.},

abstract = {The boundaries of tracking and sensing solutions are continuously being pushed. A stimulation in this field over recent years is exploiting the properties of millimeter wave (mmWave) radar to achieve simultaneous tracking and sensing of multiple objects. This paper aims to provide a critical analysis of the current literature surrounding multi-object tracking and sensing with short-range mmWave radar. There is significant literature available regarding single-object tracking using mmWave radar, demonstrating the maturity of single-object tracking systems. However, innovative research and advancements are also needed in the field of mmWave radar multi-object tracking, specifically with respect to uniquely identifying multiple target tracks across an interrupted field of view. In this article, we aim to provide an overview of the latest progress in multi-target tracking. In particular, an attempt to phrase the problem space is made by firstly defining a typical multi-object tracking architecture. We then highlight the areas for potential advancements. These areas include sensor fusion, micro-Doppler feature analysis, specialized and generalized activity recognition, gait, tagging and shape profile. Potential multi-object tracking advancements are reviewed and compared with respect to adaptability, performance, accuracy and specificity. Although the majority of the literature reviewed has a focus on human targets, most of the methodologies can be applied to targets consisting of different profiles and characteristics to that of humans. Lastly, future research directions are also discussed to shed light on research opportunities and potential approaches in the open research areas.},

ABSTRACT = {This study sought an effective detection method not only for flame but also for the smoke generated in the event of a fire. To this end, the flame region was pre-processed using the color conversion and corner detection method, and the smoke region could be detected using the dark channel prior and optical flow. This eliminates unnecessary background regions and allows selection of fire-related regions. Where there was a pre-processed region of interest, inference was conducted using a deep-learning-based convolutional neural network (CNN) to accurately determine whether it was a flame or smoke. Through this approach, the detection accuracy is improved by 5.5% for flame and 6% for smoke compared to when a fire is detected through the object detection model without separate pre-processing.},

Forest fires are commonly detected by sensor systems that are not widely available across the nation or using satellite images that offer global coverage but suffer from low temporal and spatial resolution, resulting in missing the forest fires in the early stages. Unmanned aerial systems (UAS) have been recently utilized for this purpose, noting their accessibility and low deployment cost.

ABSTRACT = {One of the United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals is climate action (SDG-13), and wildfire is among the catastrophic events that both impact climate change and are aggravated by it. In Australia and other countries, large-scale wildfires have dramatically grown in frequency and size in recent years. These fires threaten the world’s forests and urban woods, cause enormous environmental and property damage, and quite often result in fatalities. As a result of their increasing frequency, there is an ongoing debate over how to handle catastrophic wildfires and mitigate their social, economic, and environmental repercussions. Effective prevention, early warning, and response strategies must be well-planned and carefully coordinated to minimise harmful consequences to people and the environment. Rapid advancements in remote sensing technologies such as ground-based, aerial surveillance vehicle-based, and satellite-based systems have been used for efficient wildfire surveillance. This study focuses on the application of space-borne technology for very accurate fire detection under challenging conditions. Due to the significant advances in artificial intelligence (AI) techniques in recent years, numerous studies have previously been conducted to examine how AI might be applied in various situations. As a result of its special physical and operational requirements, spaceflight has emerged as one of the most challenging application fields. This work contains a feasibility study as well as a model and scenario prototype for a satellite AI system. With the intention of swiftly generating alerts and enabling immediate actions, the detection of wildfires has been studied with reference to the Australian events that occurred in December 2019. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) were developed, trained, and used from the ground up to detect wildfires while also adjusting their complexity to meet onboard implementation requirements for trusted autonomous satellite operations (TASO). The capability of a 1-dimensional convolution neural network (1-DCNN) to classify wildfires is demonstrated in this research and the results are assessed against those reported in the literature. In order to enable autonomous onboard data processing, various hardware accelerators were considered and evaluated for onboard implementation. The trained model was then implemented in the following: Intel Movidius NCS-2 and Nvidia Jetson Nano and Nvidia Jetson TX2. Using the selected onboard hardware, the developed model was then put into practice and analysis was carried out. The results were positive and in favour of using the technology that has been proposed for onboard data processing to enable TASO on future missions. The findings indicate that data processing onboard can be very beneficial in disaster management and climate change mitigation by facilitating the generation of timely alerts for users and by enabling rapid and appropriate responses.},

abstract = {Wildfires are a worldwide natural disaster causing important economic damages and loss of lives. Experts predict that wildfires will increase in the coming years mainly due to climate change. Early detection and prediction of fire spread can help reduce affected areas and improve firefighting. Numerous systems were developed to detect fire. Recently, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles were employed to tackle this problem due to their high flexibility, their low-cost, and their ability to cover wide areas during the day or night. However, they are still limited by challenging problems such as small fire size, background complexity, and image degradation. To deal with the aforementioned limitations, we adapted and optimized Deep Learning methods to detect wildfire at an early stage. A novel deep ensemble learning method, which combines EfficientNet-B5 and DenseNet-201 models, is proposed to identify and classify wildfire using aerial images. In addition, two vision transformers (TransUNet and TransFire) and a deep convolutional model (EfficientSeg) were employed to segment wildfire regions and determine the precise fire regions. The obtained results are promising and show the efficiency of using Deep Learning and vision transformers for wildfire classification and segmentation. The proposed model for wildfire classification obtained an accuracy of 85.12% and outperformed many state-of-the-art works. It proved its ability in classifying wildfire even small fire areas. The best semantic segmentation models achieved an F1-score of 99.9% for TransUNet architecture and 99.82% for TransFire architecture superior to recent published models. More specifically, we demonstrated the ability of these models to extract the finer details of wildfire using aerial images. They can further overcome current model limitations, such as background complexity and small wildfire areas.},

abstract = {Coronavirus disease (COVID‐19) is a pandemic that has caused thousands of casualties and impacts all over the world. Most countries are facing a shortage of COVID‐19 test kits in hospitals due to the daily increase in the number of cases. Early detection of COVID‐19 can protect people from severe infection. Unfortunately, COVID‐19 can be misdiagnosed as pneumonia or other illness and can lead to patient death. Therefore, in order to avoid the spread of COVID‐19 among the population, it is necessary to implement an automated early diagnostic system as a rapid alternative diagnostic system. Several researchers have done very well in detecting COVID‐19; however, most of them have lower accuracy and overfitting issues that make early screening of COVID‐19 difficult. Transfer learning is the most successful technique to solve this problem with higher accuracy. In this paper, we studied the feasibility of applying transfer learning and added our own classifier to automatically classify COVID‐19 because transfer learning is very suitable for medical imaging due to the limited availability of data. In this work, we proposed a CNN model based on deep transfer learning technique using six different pre‐trained architectures, including VGG16, DenseNet201, MobileNetV2, ResNet50, Xception, and EfficientNetB0. A total of 3886 chest X‐rays (1200 cases of COVID‐19, 1341 healthy and 1345 cases of viral pneumonia) were used to study the effectiveness of the proposed CNN model. A comparative analysis of the proposed CNN models using three classes of chest X‐ray datasets was carried out in order to find the most suitable model. Experimental results show that the proposed CNN model based on VGG16 was able to accurately diagnose COVID‐19 patients with 97.84% accuracy, 97.90% precision, 97.89% sensitivity, and 97.89% of F1‐score. Evaluation of the test data shows that the proposed model produces the highest accuracy among CNNs and seems to be the most suitable choice for COVID‐19 classification. We believe that in this pandemic situation, this model will support healthcare professionals in improving patient screening.},

The identification of skin color is an essential stage in an eclectic range of computer vision applications.

Skin color of humans can differ significantly in manifestation due to variety of aspects such as lighting, ethnicity, ageing, imaging conditions, as well as complex context, making human skin detection in complex images a difficult issue. Many techniques, on the other hand, have been created to deal with the issue of skin identification in color photographs. The skin detection algorithm proposed in this research paper is based on thresholding HSV color model bands with upper and lower bounds to create a correct mask, which is then logically ANDed with the original image to restore the skin tone pixels. For images taken in the natural world and under various illuminations and light conditions, the experimental results showed 99.135 percent precision and 99.587 percent accuracy.},

Using this prior with the haze imaging model, we can directly estimate the thickness of the haze and recover a high-quality haze-free image. Results on a variety of hazy images demonstrate the power of the proposed prior. Moreover, a high-quality depth map can also be obtained as a byproduct of haze removal.},

The main challenge of this disease is the primary diagnosis to prevent secondary infections and its spread from one person to another. Therefore, it is essential to use an automatic diagnosis system along with clinical procedures for the rapid diagnosis of COVID-19 to prevent its spread. Artificial intelligence techniques using computed tomography (CT) images of the lungs and chest radiography have the potential to obtain high diagnostic performance for Covid-19 diagnosis. In this study, a fusion of convolutional neural network (CNN), support vector machine (SVM), and Sobel filter is proposed to detect COVID-19 using X-ray images. A new X-ray image dataset was collected and subjected to high pass filter using a Sobel filter to obtain the edges of the images. Then these images are fed to CNN deep learning model followed by SVM classifier with ten-fold cross validation strategy. This method is designed so that it can learn with not many data. Our results show that the proposed CNN-SVM with Sobel filter (CNN-SVM + Sobel) achieved the highest classification accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of 99.02%, 100% and 95.23%, respectively in automated detection of COVID-19. It showed that using Sobel filter can improve the performance of CNN. Unlike most of the other researches, this method does not use a pre-trained network. We have also validated our developed model using six public databases and obtained the highest performance. Hence, our developed model is ready for clinical application.}

Recently, there has been much development in detecting roads in high-resolution (HR) satellite images based on semantic segmentation. However, the objects being segmented in such images are of small size, and not all the information in the images is equally important when making a decision. This paper proposes a novel approach to road detection based on semantic segmentation and edge detection. Our approach aims to combine these two techniques to improve road detection, and it produces sharp-pixel segmentation maps, using the segmented masks to generate road edges. In addition, some well-known architectures, such as SegNet, used multi-scale features without refinement; thus, using attention blocks in the encoder to predict fine segmentation masks resulted in finer edges. A combination of weighted cross-entropy loss and the focal Tversky loss as the loss function is also used to deal with the highly imbalanced dataset. We conducted various experiments on two datasets describing real-world datasets covering the three largest regions in Saudi Arabia and Massachusetts. The results demonstrated that the proposed method of encoding HR feature maps effectively predicts sharp segmentation masks to facilitate accurate edge detection, even against a harsh and complicated background.},

abstract={The maritime sector confronts an escalating challenge with the emergence of onboard fires aboard in ships, evidenced by a pronounced uptick in incidents in recent years. The ramifications of such fires transcend immediate safety apprehensions, precipitating repercussions that resonate on a global scale. This study underscores the paramount importance of ship fire detection as a proactive measure to mitigate risks and fortify maritime safety comprehensively. Initially, we created and labeled a custom ship dataset. The collected images are varied in their size, like having high- and low-resolution images in the dataset. Then, by leveraging the YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection algorithm we developed an efficacious and accurate ship fire detection model for discerning the presence of fires aboard vessels navigating marine routes. The ship fire detection model was trained on 50 epochs with more than 25,000 images. The histogram equalization (HE) technique was also applied to avoid destruction from water vapor and to increase object detection. After training, images of ships were input into the inference model after HE, to be categorized into two classes. Empirical findings gleaned from the proposed methodology attest to the model’s exceptional efficacy, with the highest detection accuracy attaining a noteworthy 0.99% across both fire-afflicted and non-fire scenarios.},

abstract = {The detection of smoke in a fire is a very important research topic because a large amount of carbon monoxide, which is potentially lethal, can be generated and released in the early stages of a fire. In particular, if a fire occurs in the form of smoldering combustion, it produces a glowing combustion without flames on the surface of the heat source, and the temperature is over 1000 °C. In this study, the dark channel prior, an algorithm previously used for haze removal, is used to detect areas where smoke may exist. The dark channel characteristic makes it possible to effectively detect the smoke area included background interference or noise. Additionally, in order to detect the characteristic that the smoke generated from the fire rises due to the density difference at high temperatures, the area of the smoke was detected using the optical flow technique based on the Lucas–Kanade method. Image pre-processing using the dark channel prior and the optical flow technique can effectively detect the smoke areas and significantly reduce false positive rate. Through this, in order to accurately determine the filtered region as smoke or non-smoke, a Convolutional Neural Network was employed. As a result, it was confirmed that accuracy and precision were improved by 4% and 7%, respectively, compared to object detection models that performed detection without image pre-processing.},

abstract={Wildfire smoke is an increasing environmental health threat to which children are particularly vulnerable, for both physiologic and behavioral reasons. To address the need for improved public health messaging this review summarizes current knowledge and knowledge gaps in the health effects of wildfire smoke in children, as well as tools for public health response aimed at children, including consideration of low-cost sensor data, respirators, and exposures in school environments. There is an established literature of health effects in children from components of ambient air pollution, which are also present in wildfire smoke, and an emerging literature on the effects of wildfire smoke, particularly for respiratory outcomes. Low-cost particulate sensors demonstrate the spatial variability of pollution, including wildfire smoke, where children live and play. Surgical masks and respirators can provide limited protection for children during wildfire events, with expected decreases of roughly 20%  and 80% for surgical masks and N95 respirators, respectively. Schools should improve filtration to reduce exposure of our nation’s children to smoke during wildfire events. The evidence base described may help clinical and public health authorities provide accurate information to families to improve their decision making.},

abstract = {Summary
Wildfires burn extensive forest areas around the world each year. In many locations, fire-prone forest catchments are utilised for the supply of potable water to small communities up to large cities. Following wildfire, increased erosion rates and changes to runoff generation and pollutant sources may greatly increase fluxes of sediment, nutrients and other water quality constituents, potentially contaminating water supplies. Most research to date has focused on suspended sediment exports and concentrations after wildfire. Reported first year post-fire suspended sediment exports varied from 0.017 to 50tha−1year−1 across a large range of catchment sizes (0.021–1655km2). This represented an estimated increase of 1–1459 times unburned exports. Maximum reported concentrations of total suspended solids in streams for the first year after fire ranged from 11 to ∼500,000mgL−1. Similarly, there was a large range in first year post-fire stream exports of total N (1.1–27kgha−1year−1) and total P (0.03–3.2kgha−1year−1), representing a multiple change of 0.3–431 times unburned, while NO3- exports of 0.04–13.0kgha−1year−1 (3–250 times unburned) have been reported. NO3-, NO2-, and NH3/NH4+ concentrations in streams and lakes or reservoirs may increase after wildfire but appear to present a generally low risk of exceeding drinking water guidelines. Few studies have examined post-fire exports of trace elements. The limited observations of trace element concentrations in streams after wildfire found high levels (well over guidelines) of Fe, Mn, As, Cr, Al, Ba, and Pb, which were associated with highly elevated sediment concentrations. In contrast, Cu, Zn, and Hg were below or only slightly above guideline values. Elevated Na+, Cl− and SO42- solute yields have been recorded soon after fire, while reports of concentrations of these constituents were mostly confined to coniferous forest areas in North America, where maximum sampled values were well below recommended limits. Likewise, reported wildfire effects on dissolved organic carbon were generally minor and elevated concentrations largely reflected background conditions. Available cyanide concentrations in small streams may approach levels of concern soon after fire, but increases are likely to be of short duration. Post-fire concentrations of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in streams have been found to increase but remained within the recommended limit. Large increases in exports and concentrations of some constituents after wildfire indicate the potential for impacts on water supply from forest catchments. In response, various water treatment measures may be required and in the absence of adequate treatment facilities or alternative sources, water supplies may be vulnerable to disruption.}

abstract = {Wildfires pose a significant risk to human livelihoods and are a substantial health hazard due to emissions of toxic smoke. Previous studies have shown that climate change, increasing atmospheric CO2, and human demographic dynamics can lead to substantially altered wildfire risk in the future, with fire activity increasing in some regions and decreasing in others. The present study re-examines these results from the perspective of air pollution risk, focussing on emissions of airborne particulate matter (PM2. 5), combining an existing ensemble of simulations using a coupled fire–dynamic vegetation model with current observation-based estimates of wildfire emissions and simulations with a chemical transport model. Currently, wildfire PM2. 5 emissions exceed those from anthropogenic sources in large parts of the world. We further analyse two extreme sets of future wildfire emissions in a socio-economic, demographic climate change context and compare them to anthropogenic emission scenarios reflecting current and ambitious air pollution legislation. In most regions of the world, ambitious reductions of anthropogenic air pollutant emissions have the potential to limit mean annual pollutant PM2. 5 levels to comply with World Health Organization (WHO) air quality guidelines for PM2. 5. Worst-case future wildfire emissions are not likely to interfere with these annual goals, largely due to fire seasonality, as well as a tendency of wildfire sources to be situated in areas of intermediate population density, as opposed to anthropogenic sources that tend to be highest at the highest population densities. However, during the high-fire season, we find many regions where future PM2. 5 pollution levels can reach dangerous levels even for a scenario of aggressive reduction of anthropogenic emissions.},

Seventy taxa had a substantial proportion (>30%) of habitat impacted; 21 of these were already listed as threatened with extinction. To avoid further species declines, Australia must urgently reassess the extinction vulnerability of fire-impacted species and assist the recovery of populations in both burnt and unburnt areas. Population recovery requires multipronged strategies aimed at ameliorating current and fire-induced threats, including proactively protecting unburnt habitats.

One issue hindering a high accuracy of computer vision-based wildfire detection is the potential for water mists and clouds to be marked as wildfire smoke due to the similar appearance in images, leading to an unacceptable high false alarm rate in real-world wildfire early warning cases. This paper proposes a novel hybrid wildfire smoke detection approach by combining the multi-layer ResNet architecture with SVM to extract the smoke image dynamic and static characteristics, respectively. The ResNet model is improved via the SE attention mechanism and fully convolutional network as SE-ResNet. A fusion decision procedure is proposed for wildfire early warning. The proposed detection method was tested on open datasets and achieved an accuracy of 98.99%. The comparisons with AlexNet, VGG-16, GoogleNet, SE-ResNet-50 and SVM further illustrate the improvements.},

abstract={Photoelectric smoke detectors are used for early detection of building fires, and sensitivity adjustment is generally performed using white smoke generated by the burning of filter paper. Therefore, when black smoke of the same concentration is introduced, the detector is often not activated. To address this problem, differences in the distribution of light scattered by smoke of various colors were analyzed. A light-scattering chamber with a light-receiving unit for various scattering angles was constructed to measure the scattered light generated inside the chamber of the smoke detector. The light scattering distribution was measured for smoke generated from three combustibles—filter paper (white smoke), kerosene (black smoke), and polyurethane (gray-black smoke)—and three analysis criteria were applied. By identifying a section where the measured values were concentrated for a specific analysis criterion and scattering angle, it was confirmed that some combustibles can be distinguished. Specifically, criterion III, a probabilistic section, was presented to determine which combustible smoke particles were close by applying the proposed section in a complex manner. A preliminary study was conducted to evaluate a methodology for the color classification of smoke particles flowing into a smoke detector chamber; this can be utilized as a foundation for determining optical properties.},

Lack of information of the fire front causes many accidents. Using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to cover wildfire is promising because it can replace humans in hazardous fire tracking and significantly reduce operation costs. In this paper, we propose a distributed control framework designed for a team of UAVs that can closely monitor a wildfire in open space, and precisely track its development. The UAV team, designed for flexible deployment, can effectively avoid in-flight collisions and cooperate well with neighbors. They can maintain a certain height level to the ground for safe flight above fire. Experimental results are conducted to demonstrate the capabilities of the UAV team in covering a spreading wildfire.},

abstract = {Automatic liver tumor segmentation can facilitate the planning of liver interventions. For diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma, dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) can yield a higher sensitivity than contrast-enhanced CT. However, most studies on automatic liver lesion segmentation have focused on CT. In this study, we present a deep learning-based approach for liver tumor segmentation in the late hepatocellular phase of DCE-MRI, using an anisotropic 3D U-Net architecture and a multi-model training strategy. The 3D architecture improves the segmentation performance compared to a previous study using a 2D U-Net (mean Dice 0.70 vs. 0.65). A further significant improvement is achieved by a multi-model training approach (0.74), which is close to the inter-rater agreement (0.78). A qualitative expert rating of the automatically generated contours confirms the benefit of the multi-model training strategy, with 66 % of contours rated as good or very good, compared to only 43 % when performing a single training. The lesion detection performance with a mean F1-score of 0.59 is inferior to human raters (0.76). Overall, this study shows that correctly detected liver lesions in late-phase DCE-MRI data can be automatically segmented with high accuracy, but the detection, in particular of smaller lesions, can still be improved.},

The performance of AI tools in screening for this task may vary widely and has been tested in the literature in various datasets. However, no scientometric report has provided a systematic overview of this scientific area. This article presents a systematic and bibliometric review of recent advances in neuronal network modeling approaches, mainly of deep learning, to outline the multiple research directions of the field in terms of algorithmic features. Therefore, a detailed systematic review of the most relevant publications addressing fully automatic semantic segmenting liver structures in Computed Tomography (CT) images in terms of algorithm modeling objective, performance benchmark, and model complexity is provided. The review suggests that fully automatic hybrid 2D and 3D networks are the top performers in the semantic segmentation of the liver. In the case of liver tumor and vasculature segmentation, fully automatic generative approaches perform best. However, the reported performance benchmark indicates that there is still much to be improved in segmenting such small structures in high-resolution abdominal CT scans.},
