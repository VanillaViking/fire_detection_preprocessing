abstract = {Wildfire is one of the most critical natural disasters that poses a serious threat to human lives as well as ecosystems. One issue hindering a high accuracy of computer vision-based wildfire detection is the potential for water mists and clouds to be marked as wildfire smoke due to the similar appearance in images, leading to an unacceptable high false alarm rate in real-world wildfire early warning cases. This paper proposes a novel hybrid wildfire smoke detection approach by combining the multi-layer ResNet architecture with SVM to extract the smoke image dynamic and static characteristics, respectively. The ResNet model is improved via the SE attention mechanism and fully convolutional network as SE-ResNet. A fusion decision procedure is proposed for wildfire early warning. The proposed detection method was tested on open datasets and achieved an accuracy of 98.99%. The comparisons with AlexNet, VGG-16, GoogleNet, SE-ResNet-50 and SVM further illustrate the improvements.},
